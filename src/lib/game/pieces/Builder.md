## Builder

Movement: The Builder moves one square at a time, orthogonally (up, down, left, right). It cannot move diagonally.

Land Tile Movement: The Builder can move land tiles that are orthogonal to it to new positions that are orthogonal to that land tileâ€™s position.

Land Tile Removal: The Builder can remove land tiles that are orthogonal to it. Any piece that was on that land tile is sent to the Graveyard, and the land tile itself is sent to the community pool.

Land Tile Placement: The Builder can place tiles from the community pool onto a water space. The tile must be placed orthogonally to the Builder. If that piece is placed on an occupied water space, any pieces on that space are sent to the Graveyard.

Capture: The builder can only capture by placing or moving land tiles onto a piece, or by, removing land tiles from underneath a piece
Edge Cases: If the Builder removes the tile it itself occupies, the Builder goes to the Graveyard, and the land tile is placed into the community pool.
