## Turtle

Movement: The Turtle moves one square at a time, and can move diagonally or orthogonally.

Capture: The Turtle can attack pieces on land tiles that are orthogonally to it. It can also attack anything on its back.

Carrying Pieces: The Turtle can carry one piece at a time on its back. When a piece is carried, it moves with the Turtle when it moves. A player must use a turn to get a piece onto the Turtleâ€™s back.

Edge Cases: 
- The Turtle functions as an adjacent tile for the Citadel to place new pieces onto. 
- The Turtle functions as a land tile for the purpose of connecting the 2 Citadels with straight lines.
