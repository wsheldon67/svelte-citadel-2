## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture & Foundation

### Game Engine (Copy-and-Test Design)
- [x] Design and implement core game state structure (deep copyable)
- [x] Create action-based state management system (initial state + actions list)
- [x] Implement game engine with `isSimulation` flag to prevent recursive validation
- [x] Add state copying functionality for "what-if" scenarios
- [ ] Create undo/redo functionality
- [x] Design extensible piece authoring API (intuitive for beginners and LLMs)
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Simplified player management by storing both player IDs and display names directly in GameState, removing the need for separate playerNames mapping in Svelte components
- [x] Implement base `Piece` class with flexible action system
- [x] Create pluggable action classes (`Move`, `Capture`, `Place`, custom actions)
- [x] Add comprehensive rule validation system (`RuleViolation` exceptions)
- [x] Design game variant system from the ground up (Variant base, hooks, class-based availability)

### Data Models (Extensible Architecture)
- [x] Create `Board` class (infinite 2D grid with variant support)
- [x] Implement `Land` tile system with custom properties
- [x] Create `Water` space handling with piece interactions
- [x] Design `Citadel` class with variant-specific rules and connectivity
  - [x] Implement base `Citadel` piece (type + ownership; can be placed and captured)
  - [x] Enforce citadel connectivity validation in engine (path-finding)
- [x] Implement flexible player management system (2+ players, teams)
- [x] Create `Graveyard` and dynamic piece pools (Personal/Community/Variant-specific)
- [x] Design piece property system for complex interactions

## üé® User Interface & Experience

### Interactive Board
- [x] Create responsive game board component
- [x] Implement tile highlighting system
- [ ] Add piece selection and action preview
- [ ] Create floating action menus for complex pieces
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop functionality (optional)

### UI Components

### Visual Design
- [ ] Finalize default built-in art sets for all pieces (static assets in repo)
- [ ] Implement custom art upload system (user-provided sets stored in Firebase Storage)
- [ ] Add art set selection in lobby (unique per player + host-selected shared set)
- [ ] Design cohesive visual theme

#### Own Art System (Decision + Tasks)
- [x] Decision: Default/built-in art are static assets; user uploads live in Firebase Storage
- [x] Provide 7 built-in sets: 6 player sets (0‚Äì5) + 1 shared/unowned set
  - [x] Organize static art at `static/art/{setId}/{Piece}.png` (e.g., `0/Bird.png`)
  - [x] Add remaining built-in sets for all current pieces
- [x] Art resolver with fallback order
  - [x] Priority: player's selected user set ‚Üí selected built-in set
  - [x] Unowned Pieces priority - set chosen for this purpose by host -> default unowned pieces set.
  - [ ] Cache/version strategy for static and uploaded assets
- [ ] Lobby UI behaviors
  - [ ] Enforce unique art set per player (disable taken sets)
  - [ ] Host selects the shared/unowned set
  - [ ] Live conflict resolution as players join/leave or change selection
- [ ] Upload pipeline for custom sets
  - [ ] Client validation (type/size), optional square crop/resize (64‚Äì512px)
  - [ ] Convert/store as PNG/WebP under `users/{uid}/artSets/{setId}/{Piece}.png`
  - [ ] Generate thumbnail/preview
- [ ] Metadata & persistence
  - [ ] Firestore: `users/{uid}/artSets/{setId}` (name, pieces present, thumbnail, createdBy)
  - [ ] Lobby/game: selected set per player + host-selected shared set id
- [ ] Security & access
  - [ ] Storage rules: owners write; reads limited to participants of active games using the set
  - [ ] Firestore rules to list only own sets (no public sharing initially)
- [ ] Performance & offline
  - [ ] Preload built-in sets used in current match; cache via Service Worker/SvelteKit
  - [ ] Use responsive image sizes and appropriate Cache-Control headers
- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Unit tests for resolver fallback (missing piece, missing set, offline)
  - [ ] Integration tests for lobby uniqueness and host shared-set behavior
