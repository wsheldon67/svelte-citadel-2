# Citadel

Citadel is a table-top game played with wooden tiles. The terrain is made of up land tiles, and space that has no land tile is considered to be water.

Pieces are placed on the board, adjacent to a Citadel owned by the player, usually on land tiles but sometimes on water adjacent to the land.

Each different kind of piece has unique rules, but pieces can typically be Placed, Move, or Capture, and sometimes have other actions.

In a standard game, a player loses when their Citadel is captured.
