Its not necessary to support all of these variations. This document serves as an example of the kind of extensions an entry-level developer might want to make to the game.

# General
## No Citadel
Players take turns placing their pieces on the board and you win by eliminating the other players pieces

Capture and hold a certain number of neutral tiles, like we take turns placing neutral tiles as part of the building phase, and then if you occupy 3 of them you win the game.

Only 1 person has a citadel, set number of rounds to take it

# Pieces
- A piece that is better in some way, but you have to flip a coin or something for it to work at all. Like a gamble
- Engineer
    * Something to do with blockades/defense
- Tollman
    * Blockade, can't take or be taken
- Piece that can be moved by either player
- Warlock
    * Steals opponents pieces
- Mind Control
    * Limits move choices of opponents pieces
    * Maybe let you move an opponent's piece?
- Some guy that “levels up” or otherwise gets better. Werewolf?
- Buffs other guys
- Some guys that work as a pair
- Stealth guy
- Golem
    * Tanky
- Ghost
    * Can kill but can’t take citadel? Seems too good
- Banshee
    * Temporarily stuns other pieces
- Succubus
    * Opponents pieces can only move in the direction of the succubus? Seems too good, but I like the idea of a distraction
- Lich
    * Doesn’t go to hell, but goes back to the citadel after a delay of 1 turn, otherwise functions like a pawn that can’t go diagonal
- Shapeshifter
    * Can change into something else but with a delay or some other downside
    * Nearest piece?
    * Captured piece?
- Piece that teleports to the opposite side of the map
- Piece that places teleporters
- Piece that places a new place where the opponents pieces drop
